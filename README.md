I wanted a website to help me focus on projects and learning while keeping track of progress on different subjects. 

My personal goal is to reach 1000 hours of javascript learning/projects, and with the help of this new web application I made, I can help myself focus using a 
personal timer and track my progress.

Q: What is the Pomodoro technique?
A: The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Here you can track your progress, document your learning hours, and set custom timers and break periods.
But, to keep track of your progress and documenting your learning hours, you need to create an account to store data.
